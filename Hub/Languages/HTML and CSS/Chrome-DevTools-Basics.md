# What are Chrome Dev Tools?

Chrome DevTools is a joint set of web developer tools built into the Google Chrome Browser. These tools give us the capability to debug, inspect, and edit a website. We can also use them to measure a page's performance. 

The most common way to open up the dev tools is to right click somewhere on a website and select "Inspect Element"

Combined with a [basic understanding of HTML and CSS](HTML-CSS-Basics), you can easily copy elements such as color, transition times, and other parts of websites to your own designs.
